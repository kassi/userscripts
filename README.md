Collection of userscripts to be used with GreaseMonkey, GreaseKit or my current favorite Safari extension NinjaKit.

## coderwall.js

Enhances the coderwall website:
* adds an accesskey to the pro tip search.
  To be consistent to OSX, it uses **SPACE** as the access key.
  While `cmd + SPACE` opens Spotlight,
  `alt + cmd + SPACE` opens System File Search and
  `alt + SPACE` opens Dash search,
  pressing `ctrl + alt + SPACE` now opens the search on this page.
* additionally you can close the search dialog with `ESC` now.

## gcextensions.user.js

Enhances the geocaching.com website by adding often needed Links to the main menu.
