Collection of userscripts to be used with GreaseMonkey, GreaseKit or my current favorite Safari extension NinjaKit.

## coderwall.js

Enhances the coderwall website:
* adds an accesskey to the pro tip search.
  To be consistent to OSX, it uses **SPACE** as the access key.
  While `cmd + SPACE` opens Spotlight,
  `alt + cmd + SPACE` opens System File Search and
  `alt + SPACE` opens Dash search,
  pressing `ctrl + alt + SPACE` now opens the search on this page.
* additionally you can close the search dialog with `ESC` now.

## gcextensions.user.js

Enhances the geocaching.com website:
* adds often needed links to the main menu.

## gclogextension.user.js

Enhances the geocaching.com logging page:
* counts and stores number of caches and FTF
* adds buttons to insert next TFTC / FTF easily
* adds smart buttons to insert smileys

This is a grown version of the userscript that has some TODOs:
* Use number of caches displayed on page instead of stored version
* Refactor and clean up
* or rewrite
* or better: add to gcextensions.user.js

## getpocket.user.js

Enhances the getpocket website:
* opens _tags_ on startup
